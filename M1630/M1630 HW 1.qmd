## Exercise 1: Develop an algorithm that takes in two inputs a and b and outputs their average. Draw a flowchart for your algorithm.

```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
A(Start) --> B[/Input: x , y/]
B-->C[/Output: Average of x , y/]
C-->D(Stop)
```

## Exercise 2: Consider the following scenario. Suppose that you can buy an avocado at the grocery store for \$1 or 5 avocados for \$3. Develop an algorithm for computing the minimum price for buying at least n avocados where 1\<= n \<= 5 and draw a flowchart for your algorithm.

```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
A(Start) --> B[/n = 0, price = 1, deal = 5 * 3/5/]
B--> C{Is deal >= n * price?}
C-- Yes --> D[/Output: n/]
C-- No --> E[n = n+1]
E--> C
D-->G(Stop)
```

## Exercise 3: Develop an algorithm that takes in the real number x and outputs the value of sgn(x). Draw a flowchart for your algorithm.

```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
A(Start)-->B[Input x]
B-->C{Is x >= 0?}
C-- If Greater --> D[/Output: 1/]
C-- If Equal --> E[/Output: 0/]
C-- Otherwise --> F[/Output: -1/]
D-->G(Stop)
E-->G(Stop)
F-->G(Stop)
```
